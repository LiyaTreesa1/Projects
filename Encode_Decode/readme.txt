# Encoding and Decoding using Doubly Linked List

This C program demonstrates a simple encoding and decoding mechanism using a doubly linked list. It encodes a string by XORing each character with a key, stores the encoded data in a doubly linked list, and then decodes it back to the original string.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LiyaTreesa1/Projects.git
   cd Projects


Program Description
Node structure: Defines the node for the doubly linked list.
DLL structure: Defines the doubly linked list with head and tail pointers.
append_to_list function: Adds a new node with the encoded character to the list.
freethelist function: Frees the memory allocated for the list.
encode_the_string function: Encodes the input string using XOR and appends to the list.
print_the_encoded function: To print the encoded data
decoded_string function: Decodes the list back to the original string using XOR.
